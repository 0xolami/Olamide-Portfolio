             <p>Hi, Welcome to the about me page you've already know my name and age so i'd just lay an emphasise
                on that, My name is Ahmed Olamide Hameed but you can call me Deemah and i started my coding and tech journey at the age of 15yrs
                old, I love exploring the world of technology and am an adventurous person.
                Even as a teenager in my country i faced so many challenges but i believe in one word which is "NEVER GIVE UP".
                And to talk about my school i do come out first when it comes to tech and that's one thing i love, I graduated from highschool this year (21st, of July 2024) with a very good grade been a valedictorian.
                I'm also exploring on been a Web3 developer because that would give me more insight about tech and am 
                also looking forward to meeting other techies like me so we can grow together and achieve alot of things. When i said am looking forward to meet other techies i really meant it because i really need people to crack funny tech jokes with like if brain equal to empty take coffee else keep coding and all sort of things 
                 am also looking forward to start going to programmers convention or gathering because i have never been to one before
                
                Please do well to reach me on any of my social media in the home page. <br><br>
                  THANK YOUðŸ˜Š.</p>
